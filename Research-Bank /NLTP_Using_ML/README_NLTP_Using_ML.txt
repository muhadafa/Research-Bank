Thesis Title
Natural Language Text Processing Using Machine Learning Techniques

Abstract
The rapidly developing field of machine-to-man (M2M) communication enables machines to interact with humans naturally. This research aims to improve Natural Language Processing (NLP) accuracy in text pronunciation errors of lambdacism (interswitch of /L/ and /R/ phonemes) among Igbo native English speakers. Using an intersection of machine learning algorithms, this study applies novel techniques: pre-processing (Feature extraction via Bag-of-Words, Mel-Coefficient Frequency Cepstral Coefficients MFCC), Tokenization, Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Text/Audio normalization, and Automatic Speech Recognition. The goal is to enhance NLP systems' accuracy in resolving lexical, semantic, and syntactic ambiguities.
